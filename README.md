# KMeansClustering 
A C++ implementation of the 'K Means Clustering' algorithm, developed in Visual Studio Community 2017. The code is used to demonstrate the simplicity of the K means (LLoyd's Algorithm). Please take note that this project is still being built and therefore might lack some functionality.
 
## Getting Started 
 
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. 
 
### Installing 
 
A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development environment running 
 
Since there are no dependencies, the code can be simply run by just loading the project files inside your project. Please note this project is currently being developed using a console, therefore future branches might include unwanted functions.
